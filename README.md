This is a program that generates the file infrastructure for an entire volume of The Tech.

To make a new Volume of The Tech, create a file titled V138 (or whatever Volume number) in the top level of The Tech's Drive. Inside the Volume folder, create a spreadsheet called "volume_master". This spreadsheet needs to follow the format of the "volume_master" as shown in the folder "Volume Template" with appropriate dates, issue numbers, and notes updated to reflect the upcoming Volume.

Permissions: At the moment, my plan for permissions is not an automated process. Right now, making sure the right folks have the right types of access to various files relies on having folks send links so that anyone with the link to the folder has edit permissions or so forth. The reason I'm starting things off this way is that otherwise we would need to collect all email addresses for those with access and a lot of Tech staff use multiple email accounts (gmails and MIT accounts) and this could get messy. Having to have old and new staff create a gmail account and make sure they are signed in might be cumbersome. I think it would just be easier to send a blanket link. Otherwise, a future addition to this project would be some sort of top-level spreadsheet that acts as a database for who should have which permissions for what files. In the meantime, I will nest files in such a way that top-level officers have access to everything, department level officers have access to their department, and so forth.


Config Sheet:
The config sheet needs to be as follows:
|Parent | the folder ID number (from URL)|
